kicad-stuff
===========

This is my collection of KiCAD projects. I make no guarantee that they are good or will pass EMC. However most work to
my level of satisfaction.

I also have a lib from custom symbols and footprints but my hygine on labeling and naming is kinda shit so use at your
own risk there as well.

### Active Projects
- Davis Receiver - TM4C + CC1125, PoE powered wireless receiver for Davis Instruments ISS
- Sea LED - TM4C based, ethernet connected, DMX lighting controller for use with marine lighting
- Weir Controller - ESP32 + TI Phy, ethernet connected, pond pump / lighting controller
- Nixie Clock - ESP32 + RTC + Switcher, fully integrated IN-18 nixie clock
- USB C Ambient Light Sensor - Goal here is to build a small dongle to regulate display brightness based on ambient light

### Deep Freeze Projects
- Keyboard - TKL, many other good options at the moment so not much drive to finish this
- High Voltage Power Supply - Was just a test board to prove out the design for the nixie clock
